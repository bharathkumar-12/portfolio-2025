Neo Asteroid is a web application that utilizes NASA's Asteroid NeoWs API to fetch and display real-time data on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). This project integrates with [NASAâ€™s Open API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to provide insights into asteroids approaching Earth, offering key details such as their size, velocity, closest approach date, and potential hazards.
